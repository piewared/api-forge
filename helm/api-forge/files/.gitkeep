# This file ensures the helm/api-forge/files/ directory is tracked by git
# even when empty. The directory is required for the Helm deployment process.
#
# During deployment, config files are copied here from the project root:
# - .env
# - config.yaml
# - PostgreSQL configs (postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, init scripts)
# - Universal entrypoint script
# - Temporal scripts
#
# These files are gitignored (see .gitignore) since they're dynamically
# generated/copied and should not be committed to version control.
